<h2 style="text-align:center">The Life & Accomplishments of Norman Walker</h2>
  <p>Norman was born on January 4, 1886 and died June 6, 1985 at the age 99 years and 5 months.  He was born in Genoa, Liguria, Italy to Robert Walker, a Baptist Minister from Scotland. The family later moved to England where in October 1910, on the S.S. Lusitania, arrived in New York City, and on November 22, 1918 was granted U. S. citizenship.

In his early 50s, Dr. Walker became seriously ill. Rather than going the traditional medical route for his sickness, he turned to Dr. H. William Baum, a chiropractor and physical therapist. At the suggestion of Dr. Baum, Dr. Walker turned his back on the Standard American Diet (SAD) of his day, and changed his diet to raw vegetarian.</p>
  <p>Following his conversion to a raw vegetarian diet, for nearly a half-century, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_W._Walker">Norman W. Walker</a> went on to prove through research and personal experience that well being and long life can go hand-in-hand. Modern-day nutritionists and medical researchers are just now discovering some of the truths Dr. Walker knew and expounded upon.

Dr. Walker himself became living proof that a longer, healthier life may be achieved, starting even in later life, through proper diet, mental soundness, and intelligent body care. He left behind his research and unique contributions to health for all to read in his numerous writings.</p>
  <p>Dr. Walker was notable for at least <strong>three reasons:</strong> (1) He was author of at least eight books published from 1937 to 1978. (2) He was the inventor of an important and innovative <a href="https://www.norwalkjuicers.com/">commercial juicer</a> that is still manufactured today. (3) He was a pioneer in the raw foods, juicing, and vegetarian movements, each of which has grown in size and scope over the years.</p>
  <p>Dr. Walker advocated a diet based solely on raw and fresh foods like vegetables, fruits, seeds and nuts. He considered cooked or baked foods dead and therefore unhealthful, saying that “while such food can, and does, sustain life in the human system, it does so at the expense of progressively degenerating health, energy, and vitality.”

As a strict vegan, he did not recommend the eating of meat, dairy or dairy products (with the exception of raw goat milk), fish or eggs. His diet suggestions also avoided such staple foods as breads, pasta, [white] rice and [refined] sugar.

  <p>
Dr. Walker devoted large sections of many of his books to the description of the different organs of the human body, explaining how the digestive system and the various glands work. He considered a healthy colon key to one’s health, and estimated that 80% of all disease begins in the colon. He wrote: <strong>“Every organ, gland and cell in the body is affected by the condition of the colon.”</strong></p>
